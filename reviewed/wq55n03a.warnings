DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 25, '3/8', 'V7') ms3.Parse.cpe_bach_keyboard.wq55n03a --
	The label 'V7' in m. 23, onset 3/8 (MC 25, onset 3/8) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of b.III, it expresses the scale degrees ('5', '7', '2', '4') [('A', 'C#', 'E', 'G')].
	The corresponding score segment has 5 within-label and 8 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 0.6153846153846154 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
