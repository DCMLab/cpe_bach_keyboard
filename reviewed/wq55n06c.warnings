DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 67, '1/4', 'viio65') ms3.Parse.cpe_bach_keyboard.wq55n06c --
	The label 'viio65' in m. 67, onset 1/4 (MC 67, onset 1/4) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of G.vi, it expresses the scale degrees ('b2', 'b4', 'b6', '7') [('F', 'Ab', 'Cb', 'D')].
	The corresponding score segment has 0 within-label and 4 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 1.0 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
