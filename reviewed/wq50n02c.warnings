DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 59, '1/4', 'i/ii') ms3.Parse.cpe_bach_keyboard.wq50n02c --
	The label 'i/ii' in m. 59, onset 1/4 (MC 59, onset 1/4) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of G.I, it expresses the scale degrees ('2', '4', '6') [('A', 'C', 'E')].
	The corresponding score segment has 1 within-label and 2 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 0.6666666666666666 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
