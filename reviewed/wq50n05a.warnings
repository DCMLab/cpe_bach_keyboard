DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 16, '3/8', 'V6') ms3.Parse.cpe_bach_keyboard.wq50n05a --
	The label 'V6' in m. 16, onset 3/8 (MC 16, onset 3/8) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of Bb.V, it expresses the scale degrees ('7', '2', '5') [('E', 'G', 'C')].
	The corresponding score segment has 0 within-label and 3 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 1.0 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
