DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 33, '1/4', 'I6') ms3.Parse.cpe_bach_keyboard.wq55n02a --
	The label 'I6' in m. 30, onset 1/4 (MC 33, onset 1/4) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of F.V, it expresses the scale degrees ('3', '5', '1') [('E', 'G', 'C')].
	The corresponding score segment has 1 within-label and 2 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 0.6666666666666666 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
