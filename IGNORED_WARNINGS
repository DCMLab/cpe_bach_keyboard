VOLTAS_WITH_DIFFERING_LENGTHS_WARNING (4, 29) ms3.Parse.cpe_bach_keyboard.wq55n02a
	Volta group of MC 29 contains voltas with different lengths: [3, 1]
    As discussed in https://github.com/DCMLab/cpe_bach_keyboard/pull/4#issuecomment-1680592532 we apply the measure numbers
    [29a|30a|31a][29b] and accept that the subsequent section begins with measures 30b and 31b.

INCOMPLETE_MC_WRONGLY_COMPLETED_WARNING (3, 65) ms3.Parse.cpe_bach_keyboard.wq56n03
    The incomplete MC 65 (timesig 3/4, act_dur 1/4) is completed by 1 incorrect duration (expected: 1/2): {66: Fraction(3, 4)}
    That's OK because MC 65 is an anacrusis which still belongs to the cadenza-like MN 63, so it is not a split bar that 
    expecting completion.

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 125, '1/8', 'viio6/III') ms3.Parse.cpe_bach_keyboard.wq56n05
	The label 'viio6/III' in m. 125, onset 1/8 (MC 125, onset 1/8) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
    Out-of-label RH C is an anticipation of the following III6.

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 125, '1/4', 'III6') ms3.Parse.cpe_bach_keyboard.wq56n05
	The label 'III6' in m. 125, onset 1/4 (MC 125, onset 1/4) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
    Out-of-label C-sharp is a passing tone.

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 20, '1/8', 'VI') ms3.Parse.cpe_bach_keyboard.wq56n06b
	The label 'VI' in m. 20, onset 1/8 (MC 20, onset 1/8) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
    Out-of-label note onsets are chromatic passing and neighbour tones.

INCOMPLETE_MC_WRONGLY_COMPLETED_WARNING (3, 90) ms3.Parse.cpe_bach_keyboard.wq57n01
    The incomplete MC 90 (timesig 1, act_dur 3/4) is completed by 1 incorrect duration (expected: 1/4): {91: Fraction(13, 4)}
    That's OK because MC 90 and MC 91 (no MN, mm. 90b in the PDF) together constitute one cadenza.

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 11, '0', 'IV') ms3.Parse.cpe_bach_keyboard.wq55n05b 
    The label 'IV' in m. 11, onset 0 (MC 11, onset 0) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
    Out-of-label note onsets constitute a chromatic embellishing run.

MCS_NOT_EXCLUDED_FROM_BARCOUNT_WARNING (1, 3) ms3.Parse.cpe_bach_keyboard.wq114n07
INCOMPLETE_MC_WRONGLY_COMPLETED_WARNING (3, 2) ms3.Parse.cpe_bach_keyboard.wq114n07
INCOMPLETE_MC_WRONGLY_COMPLETED_WARNING (3, 3) ms3.Parse.cpe_bach_keyboard.wq114n07
    Unmeasured piece.

WRONGLY_ENCODED_POSITION_WARNING (28,) ms3.Parse.cpe_bach_keyboard.wq114n07
    This was due to a bug that shifted the time signatures in a dataframe while comparing the annotations to before the PR.

INCOMPLETE_MC_WRONGLY_COMPLETED_WARNING (3, 2) ms3.Parse.cpe_bach_keyboard.wq117n14
    The incomplete MC 2 (timesig 1, act_dur 1/2) is completed by 1 incorrect duration (expected: 1/2): {3: Fraction(11, 32)}
    This and other warnings regarding this piece result from encoding a metered (but unmeasured) Fantasia according to cadenza conventions.

INCOMPLETE_MC_WRONGLY_COMPLETED_WARNING (3, 8) ms3.Parse.cpe_bach_keyboard.wq117n14
    The incomplete MC 8 (timesig 1, act_dur 1/2) is completed by 1 incorrect duration (expected: 1/2): {9: Fraction(1, 1)}
    See above.

INCOMPLETE_MC_WRONGLY_COMPLETED_WARNING (3, 17) ms3.Parse.cpe_bach_keyboard.wq117n14
    The incomplete MC 17 (timesig 1, act_dur 21/32) is completed by 1 incorrect duration (expected: 11/32): {18: Fraction(1, 1)}
    See above.

INCOMPLETE_MC_WRONGLY_COMPLETED_WARNING (3, 22) ms3.Parse.cpe_bach_keyboard.wq117n14
    The incomplete MC 22 (timesig 1, act_dur 1/2) is completed by 1 incorrect duration (expected: 1/2): {23: Fraction(1, 1)}
    See above.

MCS_NOT_EXCLUDED_FROM_BARCOUNT_WARNING (1, 3) ms3.Parse.cpe_bach_keyboard.wq117n14
    MC 3 seems to be offset from the MN's beginning but has not been excluded from barcount.
    See above.
